## Unreleased (2026-09-26)

### Correctness — defects found by checking the project's own claims

Every item below was a claim the project made about itself that was not true.
Each fix is a separate commit; the messages carry the reasoning.

- **The demo recorded nothing.** `demo --auto` printed a convincing execution
  trace and wrote nothing to the event store, so the `inspect latest` the
  README directs you to next returned "No traces found". It now records a
  synthetic run attributed to `demo-agent`, with event timestamps spread so
  the stored duration matches what it prints.
- **CI had never run.** The install step used `pip install .[all]` from the
  repository root, where there is no `pyproject.toml` — it lives in
  `reference-runtime/`. The step failed on every run, so the test suite had
  never executed and the README's "tests passing" badge had never been
  verified. `pytest` was also absent from every dependency extra, and
  `all = ["ask", ...]` referenced a sibling extra by name — which PEP 621 does
  not support — so pip resolved it to the unrelated PyPI package `ask` and
  installed a stranger's code.
- **Parsing broke on POSIX.** `parse_manifest` and `parse_workflow_yaml`
  accept either a path or raw YAML and distinguished them with
  `Path(source).exists()`, which raises `OSError(ENAMETOOLONG)` on POSIX for
  any string longer than a filename — and a manifest always is. Windows
  returns `False` instead, so it was invisible locally. This accounted for all
  18 Linux test failures; the registry and `ask` failures were downstream.
- **The proxy recorded where nothing read.** `proxy/tracer.py` opened its own
  `events.db` while every reading command opens the unified `intent.db`.
  `get_all_trace_ids()` then queried `execution_records` alone, so proxy
  traffic — recorded as events — could not be listed even once both sides
  shared a database. Fixing that surfaced an `UnboundLocalError`: the renderer
  read `cost`, `tokens` and `error` outside the branch that assigns them, and
  a trace without an execution record is exactly that case.
- **`inspect` printed the timeline header twice**, with the totals stranded
  between the two copies.

### Corrected claims

- **"Ten frozen specifications"** was wrong. Six of the ten are marked Frozen;
  three are still `Design Draft v0.1`.
- **`COMMERCIAL.md` sold features that are not gated.** Nothing is gated:
  there is no licence check in the codebase, `security policy` and
  `audit report` run in the free build, and SSO does not exist. The paid tier
  is now labelled as an intention rather than a product.
- **Domain references.** `docs/CNAME` declared `intent-os.org` as the GitHub
  Pages custom domain, for a domain the project does not own — which would let
  anyone who registers it serve this site. The CNAME is removed; the site
  serves from `haihaoxu.github.io/intentos/`. Publisher identifiers in
  manifests, the `mkdocs.yml` site URL and the OpenRouter attribution header
  are updated to point at locations the project controls.

## v0.15.0 (2026-07-24)

### Code Hygiene — Comprehensive Audit Fixes

- **Deleted `core/store_base.py`** — 121 lines of unused abstract base class. No store inherited from it.
- **Fixed `preferred_models` bug** — Agent export was storing capability names (e.g. "financial_analysis") instead of model names (e.g. "gpt-4o") in the reputation summary. Now correctly queries `runtime_id`.
- **Experience model unified** — Added `occurrence_count` and `source_data` fields to the canonical `Experience` dataclass in `core/models.py` for compatibility with the experience extractor. Schema migration for existing databases.
- **Added `find_by_observation()` and `count()`** to the canonical `ExperienceStore` — used by the extractor for deduplication.
- **`VALID_EXPERIENCE_TYPES` made public** — Renamed from `_VALID_EXPERIENCE_TYPES` to `VALID_EXPERIENCE_TYPES`. Updated to 7 types (was 4).
- **`SecurityRisk` imported from `core.models`** — Added module-level comparison helpers (`_security_risk_ge`, `_security_risk_le`).
- **Removed dead code** — Unused `ExecutionRecorder` import in `event_store.py`, zombie thread in `scheduler.py`, meaningless `@staticmethod` in `conditions.py`, redundant yaml import fallback in `pricing.py`.
- **912 tests, 0 failures** — Deleted 3 `test_store_base` tests for the removed module.

---

## v0.14.0 (2026-07-24)

### Selective Memory — Decide What to Remember and Forget

- **Memory scoring** — `compute_memory_score()` scores each experience by confidence (40%), usage count (30%), and recency (30%). High-score experiences are kept, low-score ones are candidates for pruning.
- **Conflict resolution in experience creation** — When a new experience has the same `structured_trigger` as an existing one, the higher-confidence version wins. Low-confidence duplicates are automatically replaced.
- **`intent-os memory stats <agent_id>`** — Shows memory health: total experiences, breakdown by type, average confidence/usage/score, oldest experience age, and prune candidate count.
- **`intent-os memory prune <agent_id>`** — Removes low-value experiences. Keeps the top N by memory score, plus any above a minimum score threshold. Supports `--dry-run` for safe preview.
- **Self-record dedup** — Self-recorded failure experiences use `structured_trigger` for conflict resolution, so repeated failures for the same API call don't create duplicates.
- **13 new tests** — Memory scoring, conflict resolution (replace/keep/different trigger), prune with min score / top N / execution. 915 tests total, zero regressions.

---

## v0.13.0 (2026-07-24)

### Active Memory — Agent Self-Records, User Feedback, Cross-Session Recall

- **Self-record on failure** — When an LLM call fails, the proxy immediately records a `failure_pattern` experience with provider, model, error message, and structured trigger. No need to wait for the auto-extractor (which runs every 50 calls).
- **`intent-os feedback` command** — Users can directly record feedback: `intent-os feedback <agent_id> --helpful --observation "..."` or `--not-helpful`. Creates a `user_feedback` experience with structured fields.
- **Doctor now has actionable feedback** — The doctor output's "Was this diagnosis helpful?" hint now shows runnable `intent-os feedback` commands instead of generic advice.
- **Cross-session active loading** — When the context injector has no user query to search against, it proactively loads top experiences (by confidence) plus recent ones, so every new session starts with the agent's most relevant knowledge.
- **ExperienceStore sort_by** — `sort_by="confidence"` and `sort_by="usage"` parameters added to `list()` for flexible querying.
- **7 new tests** — Feedback helpful/not-helpful, self-record, sort_by confidence and default. 902 tests total, zero regressions.

## v0.12.0 (2026-07-24)

### Environment + Relationship Context — SPEC-0010 Complete

- **`core/environment_context.py`** — New module: `detect_environment()` auto-detects available adapters (by env var + Ollama ping), platform, Python version, and pricing overrides. Pure runtime self-check, no database needed.
- **`core/relationship_context.py`** — New module: `compute_relationships(agent_id)` aggregates team membership and cross-agent collaboration from existing execution_records sharing the same context_id.
- **`intent-os doctor` Environment block** — Doctor output now shows runtime version, platform, adapters status, and default adapter.
- **Injector includes environment + relationships** — `build_injection_prompt()` now injects environment info (runtime, adapters) and relationship info (teams, collaborators) into the LLM system prompt.
- **Context retrieval covers all 6 layers** — `retrieve_context()` now searches identity, capability, experience, environment, and relationship context.
- **16 new tests** — Environment detection, format output, relationship aggregation, empty profiles. 895 tests total, zero regressions.
- **SPEC-0010: Complete** — All six layers of Agent Context now have reference implementations.

---

## v0.11.0 (2026-07-24)

### Context Retrieval — Relevant Context, Not Everything

- **`core/context_retrieval.py`** — New module: `retrieve_context(agent_id, query)` finds the most relevant Capability + Experience entries using keyword matching. No vector DB needed — just structured field matching with a scoring formula that factors in confidence and sample count.
- **Injector now uses retrieval** — `build_injection_prompt()` accepts a `query` parameter. When provided, only context relevant to the user's request is injected. When absent, falls back to loading recent experiences. Saves ~100-300 tokens per call by skipping irrelevant experiences.
- **Proxy extracts user queries** — The proxy automatically extracts the user's latest message from the LLM request body and passes it to the context injector. OpenAI and Anthropic formats both supported.
- **`intent-os context search <agent_id> <query>`** — New CLI command for ad-hoc context retrieval. Shows scored results with source (capability/experience), relevance, and confidence.
- **13 new tests** — Keyword extraction, exact/partial/no-match retrieval, capability matching, empty query fallback, max results limiting, and format output. 879 tests total, zero regressions.

---

## v0.10.0 (2026-07-24)

### Capability Context — Skills with Evidence (SPEC-0010 Layer 2)

- **`core/capability_context.py`** — New module: `compute_capability_profile(agent_id)` aggregates execution records into structured capability profiles with proven success rates, sample counts, cost/token metrics, and preferred models. Not tags — evidence-backed capability proof.
- **`agent get` Capability Context block** — The person-card output now shows each capability with level (expert/proficient/practitioner), success rate, task count, and proven patterns.
- **`context_injector` capability injection** — The proxy now injects "Proven capabilities" into the LLM system prompt: "Financial Analysis: 92% success (3200 tasks, expert)".
- **Experience structured fields** — `structured_situation`, `structured_mistake`, `structured_lesson`, `structured_trigger` added to Experience model. Auto-populated by Failure Pattern extractor. Migration included for existing databases.
- **SPEC-0010 data model validated** — Identity, Capability, and Experience layers now all have working implementations. Working Context and Environment Context ready for future phases.
- **16 new tests** — Capability profile aggregation, cost/token math, level classification, agent isolation. 866 tests total, zero regressions.

---

## v0.9.0 (2026-07-24)

### MCP Agent Resources — Agents Discoverable by Any Runtime

- **MCP resources/list** — The MCP server now exposes all registered agents as URI-addressable resources (`intent-os://agents/{id}`, `/identity`, `/experiences`). Any MCP-compatible client (Claude Code, Cursor) can discover available agents via the standard MCP resource protocol.
- **MCP resources/read** — Clients can read an agent's full `.agent` package, identity profile, or recent experiences through resource URIs. Enables Runtime-native agent loading without proxy interception.
- **`intent-os mcp-server start --agent <id>`** — New `--agent` flag to associate an agent with the MCP server. The agent's identity and capabilities are immediately discoverable.
- **8 MCP resource tests** — Protocol compliance tests for resources/list and resources/read including error cases. 850 tests total, zero regressions.

---

## v0.8.0 (2026-07-24)

### Runtime Self-Awareness — Agent Knows Who It Is

- **Proxy now injects agent identity into LLM requests** — When `intent-os proxy start --agent <id>` is used, the proxy automatically injects a system prompt containing the agent's persona, traits, and recent experiences into every LLM API call. The agent now knows who it is and what it has learned.
- **`core/context_injector.py`** — New module: `build_injection_prompt()` queries AgentStore, ExperienceStore, and ContextStore to build a ~100–250 token system prompt. Handles OpenAI (system role in messages array) and Anthropic (top-level system field) formats.
- **Auto-experience-extraction** — Proxy automatically runs `ExperienceExtractor.extract_all()` every 50 LLM calls. Agent experiences grow without manual `intent-os experience extract`.
- **Doctor feedback loop** — `intent-os doctor` now shows a "Was this diagnosis helpful?" hint with the exact CLI command to record feedback.
- **7 new tests** — Context injector test suite covering identity, experiences, empty traits, cap limits, and OpenAI message formatting. 849 tests total, zero regressions.

---

## v0.7.0 (2026-07-24)

### Agent Package (.agent) — Portable Agent Asset

- **`intent-os agent export <id>`** — Export an agent to a portable `.agent` JSON file containing identity, reputation summary, and experiences. Single file, human-readable, runtime-agnostic.
- **`intent-os agent import <path.agent>`** — Import an agent from a `.agent` file into any Intent OS instance. Generates a new agent_id to avoid conflicts.
- **`core/agent_package.py`** — New module defining the `.agent` format (spec_version 1.0, format `intent-os-agent-v1`), plus `export_agent()`, `import_agent()`, `export_agent_to_file()`, `import_agent_from_file()`.
- **SPEC-0009 upgraded to Frozen v1.0** — Added complete `.agent` JSON schema, field descriptions, export/import behaviour spec, and lifecycle documentation.
- **8 new tests** — Export roundtrip, empty experiences, empty reputation, name override, invalid format rejection, experience preservation. All 842 tests passing.
- **Privacy by design** — `.agent` packages contain only identity + reputation summary. No raw execution data, no API keys, no prompts.

---

## v0.6.0 (2026-07-24)

### Agent Profile — Agent as a Person

- **Agent dataclass expanded** — Added `persona` (role description), `traits` (personality characteristics), and `avatar` (emoji/icon) fields. An agent is now more than an ID — it has identity, personality, and character.
- **`agent get` person-card output** — The `agent get` command now shows a complete character card: role, traits, status, capabilities, experience summary, execution history, cost overview, and recent runs — all in one view. Identity + Execution + Experience layers now converge in a single profile.
- **`agent update --traits +/-`** — Traits can be appended (`+cautious`), removed (`-aggressive`), or replaced (no prefix) via comma-separated syntax.
- **`agent create --persona --traits --avatar`** — New agent creation now supports role, traits, and avatar in one command.
- **SPEC-0009: Agent Asset Model** — First draft of the Agent Asset standard, defining the profile format as the foundation for portable `.agent` packages.
- **CLI --version updated** — `intent-os --version` now shows 0.6.0.

### Agent Store

- Added `set_persona()`, `add_trait()`, `remove_trait()` methods to `AgentStore`.
- Schema migration for existing databases (persona, traits, avatar columns).
