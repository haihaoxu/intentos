```bash
# Recommended — installs the current source, including fixes not yet on PyPI
pip install "git+https://github.com/haihaoxu/intentos#subdirectory=reference-runtime"

# Or from PyPI (v0.15.2, July 2026 — predates those fixes)
pip install intentos

# What happened? What went wrong? What did it cost?
intent-os doctor

# Every step your agent took, every model it called.
intent-os inspect latest

# Who is this agent? What does it know? What has it learned?
intent-os agent get <id>
```

**You get this:**

```

## AI agents have amnesia.

Claude Code spends 30 minutes solving your problem — researching, trying approaches, failing, learning from mistakes. You close the session, and **everything it learned is gone**. Tomorrow, it's a blank slate. The same struggles. The same dead ends. The same lessons it already learned.

This is the real bottleneck in AI today. Not capability. **Amnesia.**

Intent OS gives your AI agent a memory that grows with every task. Every execution, every mistake, every success is captured, structured as experience, and applied to the next call. Day by day, your agent gets smarter — not because the model changed, but because it remembers what worked and what didn’t.

Even better: that identity — role, traits, execution history, experience, capability proof — can be exported today and moved across any runtime. From Claude to GPT to Ollama. Your agent doesn’t have to start over when you switch tools. It carries everything it learned.

---

## How it works

```bash
# Start the flight recorder
intent-os proxy start

# Point your agent at it — zero code changes
export OPENAI_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8377
export ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8377

# Use your agent normally. Every action is recorded.
claude "refactor the payment module"

# See what happened, what went wrong, and what it learned
intent-os doctor
intent-os inspect latest
intent-os cost
```

Works with **Claude Code, Cursor, GitHub Copilot, or any agent** that speaks OpenAI or Anthropic APIs. One environment variable. Nothing else. Everything runs locally. One SQLite file. No cloud. No account.

---

## What you get

| Command | What it tells you |
|---------|-------------------|
| `intent-os doctor` | Health check: what happened, what went wrong, how to fix it |
| `intent-os inspect latest` | Full timeline: every model call, tool use, cost |
| `intent-os cost` | Spending: by agent, by model, daily trends |
| `intent-os proxy start` | Start recording — intercepts any OpenAI/Anthropic agent |
| `intent-os proxy doctor` | Proxy health: running status, traffic stats |
| `intent-os agent create --name "X" --persona "..." --traits "..."` | Create an agent with a role and personality |
| `intent-os agent get <id>` | Full person-card: role, traits, execution history, experience |
| `intent-os experience list --agent <id>` | What this agent learned from its past runs |
| `intent-os scan` | Security scan: dangerous tool calls in traces |
| `intent-os audit report --format html` | Compliance report: full audit trail |

---

## Which of these have you felt?

- **"It worked yesterday. Today it doesn't."** — Same task, different session. The agent doesn't remember what it learned last time. No experience carries over.

- **"I'm afraid to give it a big task."** — The agent is capable, but the bigger the task, the more files it touches. You don't know what it changed.

- **"Something went wrong. I have no idea what."** — Agent ran for 30 minutes. Failed. No stack trace. No record of what happened.

- **"Why is my API bill $300 this month?"** — Which agent? Which task? Which model? You can't answer any of those questions.

Intent OS gives you the answer to all four — before you even ask.

---

## For teams

When multiple people use multiple agents, "who did what" becomes a business question:

- **Accountability** — `intent-os cost --by agent` — who's spending what, on which model
- **Governance** — `intent-os security policy apply` — define what agents can and can't do
- **Compliance** — `intent-os audit report --format html` — full execution record, any timeframe
- **Identity** — every agent gets an ID and a profile, every execution links back to its owner

---

## Why local-first?

| Instead of... | Intent OS is... |
|--------------|----------------|
| Cloud-only tracing (LangSmith, LangFuse) | **Local-first.** Your data never leaves your machine. |
| Siloed per-platform logs | **Universal.** Works with any OpenAI/Anthropic agent. |
| Just logging | **Structured traces.** One execution → many API calls → one timeline. |
| Postgres + Redis + S3 | **One SQLite file.** No infrastructure needed. |

No API key to sign up. No dashboard to log into. Your agent's execution data is yours — it lives in `~/.intent-os/intent.db`.

---

## The bigger picture: agents that grow with you

Intent OS is the first infrastructure layer that turns AI agents from one-time tools into assets that accumulate value over time. Every task your agent completes adds to its identity, capability proof, and experience. Run it for a week, and it is smarter than day one. Run it for a month, and it knows your workflows, your preferences, your data sources. Export it, and that value moves with it to any runtime.

The seven layers of Intent OS - Context, Identity, Execution, Verification, Governance, Interoperability, Experience - form the infrastructure for an agent that does not just execute, but learns, proves, and carries its value forward.

[9 specs](https://github.com/haihaoxu/intentos/tree/main/specs), all frozen. 30+ CLI commands. 6 adapters. One local file. Any runtime.
